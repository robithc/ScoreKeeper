# ScoreKeeper

This is my Project 2 for Google Challenge Scholarship Android Basics
It's a simple app that helps you count the score and other stats of 2 teams during the match.
You click on buttons and add +1 to score of goals, fouls, yellow cards and red cards for team you choose.
You can also reset all the stats by clicking RESET button. I set orientation mode to portrait.
